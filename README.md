**Overview**\
This repository provides a foundational understanding of conda, a powerful package and environment management tool. Whether you're new to conda or looking to refresh your knowledge, this resource aims to cover the essential concepts and usage.

**Introduction**
Conda is an open-source package management and environment management system that simplifies the process of installing, managing, and sharing software packages within different computing environments. It is particularly popular in the data science and scientific computing communities for its ability to handle dependencies and create isolated environments.

**Installation**
To get started with conda, you need to install Anaconda or Miniconda. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the official conda documentation.

**Getting Started**
Once conda is installed, familiarize yourself with basic commands and concepts. The fundamental commands include creating environments, managing packages, and activating/deactivating environments.

**Creating Environments**
